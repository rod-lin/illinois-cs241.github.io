<p>This course is designed to challenge you as a programmer and new computer scientist at the University of Illinois. Rather than the sand-boxed, contained, and simple problems of your previous courses that used significant scaffolding and pre-built libraries, you will be interacting with a much more complex environment: the entire system and even computing networks.</p>
<p>Further, you will need to fully understand how memory is allocated, used, and re-used within a process. You will also need to know how input and output can be optionally buffered between processes and files. In short, it is time to remove the training wheels of and instead fling open the doors, welcoming you to the big, wide world of computing.</p>
<p>Oh, and did we mention the challenge of concurrency and solving asynchronous problems, so that your program can take advantage of the multi-core CPU inside each machine?</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to System Programming. System Programming refers to writing code that prioritizes operating system support for programmers.</p>
<p>A computer needs an operating system to manage its resources and provide support for common functions, such as accessing peripherals. There are two categories of “customers” that an operating system must support.</p>
<p>The first category is the community of users. We have all used computers, and you may recognize operating systems’ functions such as creating folders (directories) and moving files around. These are examples of operating system support for users. User support is not the objective of this course.</p>
<p>The second category of users is programmers. This course addresses this category. When you write a program, it may have to interact with physical hardware (memory, flash storage, screen, network, etc.). For example, you may want to get input from a keyboard or mouse; you may want to read some configuration file stored on disk; you may want to output data to a screen or printer; or you may want to access a remote server across a network.</p>
<p>The operating system presents common interfaces for programmers to perform these functions. It also provides useful abstractions such as “tasks” (also called processes), “threads”, and “semaphores”. You can make the computer multi-task by creating new tasks or new threads. You can make these tasks coordinate and synchronize by using semaphores. You can tell the computer the order in which you want tasks to be executed by using a scheduling policy. Finally, you can manage computer memory by calling on the function for memory management.</p>

<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>By the end of this course, you should be proficient at writing programs that take full advantage of operating system support.</p>
<p>Specifically, we need to fix an operating system and a programming language. We chose the C language running on a Linux/UNIX operating system, which implements the POSIX standard interface. This pairing of C and UNIX/Linux is used heavily by software that must provide high performance and low-level control of the program’s execution. By the end of the course, you should be proficient with this environment and should be able to write non-trivial pieces of software from web server code to your own multiplayer Internet games.</p>

<p>All lab programming assignments are equally weighted. MP programming assignments are weighted by the time given to complete them. This means that three week MPs are worth triple one week.</p>
<p>For grading, we will drop your lowest quiz score, lowest lab score, and two lab attendance grades. Sickness, vacation, sleep, <em>whatever</em>; we don’t care. we don’t care. Exceptions in rare circumstances can been arranged with the course administrator (<a href="mailto:cs241admin@illinois.edu" class="fancy-link wiki-link">cs241admin@illinois.edu</a>), or Director of Undergrad studies.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester there will be a last chance regrade option for two weeks of machine problem grades. To be able to take advantage of this opportunity you will need to have a perfect attendance grade after the drops. If you submit a <a href="./regrade_test" class="fancy-link wiki-link">test case for an assignment</a> that accurately matches the assignment <em>description</em> not the documentation along with a justification for why, then you may get one more week of machine problem regrade – this is up to the course staff’s discretion.</p>
<p>The 3-hour handwritten final exam is comprehensive and will test all CS 241 topics, including programming topics covered in the MP and Labs. Do not book your flights until the exam date is known. Early exams will not be offered. Conflict final exams will be offered if you have three exams in a 24 hour period, or you have an exam in another, smaller enrollment course at the same time.</p>
<p>Grading issues should be raised with your TA during section or by email. Missing scores need to be reported on or before the next section.</p>

<p>There are two different types of coding assignments in this course labs and machine problems.</p>
<p>Labs are primarily teaching exercises designed either to prepare you for the machine problems or to allow you to explore a topic of systems in a hands on manner. Labs may be done in a collaborative manner. You are allowed to work with each other so as to learn in the best manner for you. This can include sharing code, debugging each other’s code, and discussing the assignment at any level. You still may not publicly publish either your solutions or our code. Finally you should have a comment block with any students or other resources you used in the completion of your lab assignments. This block will not be used for grading but is needed the same way that citing your sources is required when writing a paper.</p>
<p>Machine Problems are different. While they are a key learning experience MPs are also a key assessment of your skills. These are solo exercises and you must work alone. For MPs, you may not share code in any way. This includes show, share, email, or debug each others code. You may have high level discussions with each other on the ideas in the assignments but that is it. You are responsible for keeping the code for you machine problems private this includes not letting people view your code. You may not publish your code on any open website.</p>

<p>Is this course hard? Yes, but you are bright. You’re taking computer science at UIUC. Schedule the time to do it. The two big changes from CS 225:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your code is now much smaller than the complexity of the system around it.</li>
  <li>No, we will not debug your code for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>With lecture content, one lab, one MP, and one Quiz/Midterm every week or two, it can get easy to fall behind.</p>
<p>How to fail: some students do not take the time to learn how to debug and reason about system code and then end up complaining that office hours is too busy before deadlines. If you can’t write correct solutions, you need to learn <em>exactly</em> how C works, the <em>details</em> of the system calls you are using, learn <em>better debugging</em> skills and <em>reason</em> behind synchronization. Only then can you spot and fix mistakes. Hard? Yes. Impossible? No.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts to mastery, but we can help you get there. We recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg" class="fancy-link wiki-link">Feynman technique</a> to learning. Remember, simply recognizing some text in a past exam or in the wikibook is not mastery of those concepts! Find ways to deeply engage your brain with the ideas by working actively with those ideas. Yes, this requires effort. Start the assignments early; expect to get stuck. Write code <em>slowly</em>; reason about every line of code you write. Experiment with your own mind hacks so that you have fun spending “time on task” with these materials.</p>

<p>You walk into the investor meeting ready to show your demo. You ship your code ready for a million Internet of things. You deploy your code to the Internet backbone. It had better compile and be functional.</p>
<p>Forgot to commit or your committed code that does not compile? Zero. The basic headline is that you’re not in Kansas anymore (to quote Dorothy). Don’t leave it until the last minute.</p>
<p>We will test your code on a multi-core machine; testing on your own laptop is insufficient. Don’t be surprised if race conditions that go undetected on a different machine cause your code to fail. We encourage you to develop and test your code on your CS 241 VM, which is near-identical to the grading machine. We will attempt to give you some partial credit if your code passes the tests.</p>
<p>If you have a question about your personal autograder results after the final autograde run, then feel free to make a private Piazza post titled “&lt;assignment name&gt; Autograde Question” with the folders/tags/labels <code class="highlighter-rouge">autograder</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;assignment name&gt;</code> selected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will take time to go through autograder questions, so please do not expect an immediate (or even same day or same week) response. We will try to answer you as quickly as possible.</li>
  <li><em>You must show us your test cases first. If they are not close to exhaustive, we reserve to right to not answer your question.</em></li>
  <li>We will not tell you the details of specific tests, beyond what the test description already says.</li>
  <li>These questions should be for “I have exhaustive test cases for <em>X</em>, so how am I failing <em>Y</em>?”</li>
  <li>Please mention your NetID in the post, so we can look up your code if needed.</li>

<p>CS 241 is considered a critical step in your ability to create useful programs for your later classes and beyond. Unfortunately for grading purposes, a minority of students submit code that was created by others. Cheating is taken very seriously, and all cases of cheating will be brought to the University, your department, and your college. You should understand how <a href="https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/undergradProg/Honor+Code" class="fancy-link wiki-link">academic integrity</a> applies to Computer Science courses.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> If at any point you submit an assignment that does not reflect your understanding of the material, then you have probably cheated.</p>
<p>In the cases of labs, you are allowed to collaborate with others in the class. This can include detailed debugging and code sharing.</p>
<p><strong>EVERY MACHINE PROBLEM IS A SOLO ASSIGNMENT IN THIS CLASS!</strong></p>
<p>This means you are not allowed to split the work with a partner, unlike other 2xx classes. You are, however, allowed to discuss the assignments at a very high level. If you are found to have shared code work on any machine problem, you will receive a zero on that assignment and a 10% penalty in the course for each incident where you are found to have used material that is not yours.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may not publish your solutions or leave them in “plain view”, thereby leaving your programs open to copying, which constitutes cheating. If your code (or a variation of it) is found publicly accessible, then you will receive a letter grade reduction in the class for each assignment. For example, if we find your code on GitHub for one MP then you will receive 10% penalty in the course if your code is there for two you will get a 20% penalty. You also may not publish our code anywhere publicly and you will receive the same penalty for sharing our code. If you are confused on what it means to be “publicly accessible”, then do not put your code anywhere besides your private course repository and take measures to ensure that nobody can copy your code, so that you are not charged with a violation.</p>
<p>In the case of quizzes in the CBTF, it is a violation of our course policy to access or provide access to the quiz material outside your registered window. If you are found to have done so you will receive a zero on the quiz and a 10% penalty in the course. This includes seeking descriptions of the questions from students who have taken the quiz, as well as any other method that would give you access to the quiz outside your scheduled time. If there is prep material provided in lecture or on Piazza, you are welcome to share that material freely.</p>
<p>We want you to get the most out your education, and cheating not only affects your peers, but also your level of knowledge and ability.</p>
